# Anomaly-detection-Feature-Selection
> Evaluate on three different ML model for feature selection using Breast cancer data.

> ML models: SVM, KNN and MLP.

> Report *recall* and *Precision* of each model.

# Data
> Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34]
